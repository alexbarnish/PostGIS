-- ST_ASTEXT_ROUNDED() - A PostgIS function (works in PostgIS 1 and 2) to return
-- Well Known text (WKT) with decimal places removed.
-- 
-- This complements the ST_ASTEXT() function, with the added step of removing decimal places.
-- The resulting WKT is often 50% smaller, resulting in much smaller & faster WKT downloads.
-- 
-- If you are using a SRS with small spatial units (meters or feet) then the
-- imprecision is trivial (maximum change is 0.999 meters).
-- 
-- Do not attempt this with unprojected geographic coordinates (lat & lon), 
-- as the rounding is spatially significant: one degree 60 miles at the equator, 
-- and you don't want it rounded THAT much.
-- 
-- Public domain. Redistributable without limitation or restriction.

-- The ST_ASTEXT_ROUNDED() function
-- Takes a geometry as an argument, return the WKT with decimals trimmed off
-- Example usage:     SELECT ST_ASTEXT_ROUNDED(geom) FROM locations;
